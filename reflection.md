- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

It makes it much more efficient and time saving because you don't need to rewrite methods and attributes. It overall makes the process of making similar objects a lot more clear and concise. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Although the assignment sounds overwhelming, when I began to take it one step at a time I realized it was not as complicated as I thought it would be. I would advise someone taking this course to focus on one class at a time and to not overcomplicate it. The house class was the easiest for me, and the cafe was the most difficult. I got a little stuck on the restock method in the cafe, but other than that I felt pretty confident all throughout this assignment. I would also advise people to not be afraid to look stuff up, especially with the hashtable because we haven't learned how to use it yet. I also forgot that we had a two day extension on this assignment already so please ignore the extension.txt I submitted :)
